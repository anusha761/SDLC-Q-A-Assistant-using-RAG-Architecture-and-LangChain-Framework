# SDLC-Q&A-Assistant-using-RAG-Architecture-and-LangChain-Framework
An intelligent, domain-specific chatbot designed to answer complex questions about the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** using modern **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. Built with **LangChain**, **ChromaDB** vector store, and **LLMs from HuggingFace**, this project demonstrates a scalable and enterprise-ready solution for contextual knowledge retrieval in IT environments.

# Objective
In today’s fast-paced IT environments, quick access to accurate and contextual information about SDLC processes is critical for:

- Developers  
- Project Managers  
- QA Engineers  
- DevOps Teams

This project introduces an AI-powered assistant that leverages **RAG** and **LangChain** to provide precise and contextual answers to questions related to:

- Agile, Waterfall and other methodologies  
- Software testing strategies  
- SDLC best practices and documentation

# Architecture Overview
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines two core capabilities:

1. **Retrieval** – Fetches relevant documents from a vector database (ChromaDB) using semantic search.
2. **Generation** – Uses an LLM to generate natural language answers grounded in the retrieved content.
